<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer who has been working as a Biokineticist 
  for the last 10 years, helping people improve their health and quality 
  of life through exercise.
  My greatest strengths are my work ethic and natural curiosity. 
  I enjoy the challenge of learning new skills and will readily 
  commit the time and effort required to master these skills.</p>
